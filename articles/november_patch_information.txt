Behold Zakum! Residing deep within the volcano of El Nath, Zakum awaits for the strongest Maplers to come and challenge his might. Adonis, a spiritually-attuned Hero and long lost brother of Abodis, has ventured to the town of El Nath to liberate the spirits of the townspeople.  Knowledgeable in ancient history, he seeks to perform a ritual to free the spirits of the town, now serving Zakum as his minions; he also searches for Stone Denari, an ancient currency once used in the region, to remove any and all traces of the fearsome Zakum.  He plans to use the Zakum Diamonds, jewels dropped by Zakum himself which contain the spirits he absorbed, to liberate the townspeople from the scourge of Zakum.<br />
