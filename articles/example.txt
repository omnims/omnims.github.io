<p>
This is an example article created by the default articles plugin, which
is a plugin that acts like a conduit for adding additional content to
your weblog. The plugin works by scanning the <em>articles</em>
directory for files ending with ".txt" that are new or have been
recently modified and refreshes the articles accordingly.
</p>
<p>
New articles can easily be created using the <code>add article</code>
action.
<pre>
nb [--title 'Example Article'] add article
</pre>
<p>
New articles can also be created manually using the <code>draft,
query</code> and <code>update</code> actions.
<pre>
nb draft [blog_dir]articles/example.txt
nb update main [publish]
</pre>
To remove an article simply rename it's suffix to something
other than ".txt" or remove it from the <em>articles</em> directory ...
</p>
... followed by a quick:
<pre>
nb update main [publish]
</pre>
<p>
View this article's <a href="../example.txt">meta-file</a>.
</p>
