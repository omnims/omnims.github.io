Behold Zakum! Residing deep within the volcano of El Nath, Zakum
awaits for the strongest Maplers to come and challenge his might.
Adonis, a spiritually-attuned Hero and long lost brother of Abodis,
has ventured to the town of El Nath to liberate the spirits of the
townspeople. Knowledgeable in ancient history, he seeks to perform
a ritual to free the spirits of the town, now serving Zakum as his
minions; he also searches for Stone Denari, an ancient currency
once used in the region, to remove any and all traces of the
fearsome Zakum. He plans to use the Zakum Diamonds, jewels dropped
by Zakum himself which contain the spirits he absorbed, to liberate
the townspeople from the scourge of Zakum.<br />
