<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was the second half of 2008. MapleStory players around the globe were awaiting the release of the Pirate class. Global MapleStory wasn't the only region standing by in anticipation. MapleStory SEA was also preparing for the exciting release of a brand-new Explorer branch.

<br />Even though the information displayed might not help with your MapleStory v62 server, and wasn't intended for gMS for that matter, I find it interesting to view these relics of the past. I hope these scans spark inspiration for your private server project, or at least provide a warming sense of nostalgia.
